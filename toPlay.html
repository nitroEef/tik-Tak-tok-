<h1>How To Play</h1>
<p>    
This game is created for two players. the first player will carry "O" tiles, 
while the second player will carry the "X" tiles respectively.
The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three 
in a row on a 3-by-3 grid.

To start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares,
  In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who 
 is playing "O" will go first. Players alternate placing Xs 
 and Os on the board until either player has <i> three in a row, 
 horizontally, vertically, or diagonally</i> or until all squares on
  the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three 
 Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are 
 filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then
the game is a draw.
