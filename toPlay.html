Gameplay
The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three 
in a row on a 3-by-3 grid or four in a row in a 4-by-4 grid. 

To start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares,
 usually 3-by-3 or 4-by-4. In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who 
 is playing "X" always goes first. Players alternate placing Xs 
 and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, 
 horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on
  the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three 
 Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are 
 filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then
the game is a draw. One of the game's best strategies involves creating a "fork".
 which is placing your mark in such a way that you have the opportunity to win two 
 ways on your next turn. Your opponent can only block one, thereby, you can
 win after that. The gameplay is the same if you are playing on a 4-by-4 grid. 
 The "X" player goes first. And, players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board 
 until a row is completed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or all 16 squares 
 are filled. If all 16 squares are filled and neither player has four in a row, the game is a draw.
